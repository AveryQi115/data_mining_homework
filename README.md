MNIST dataset: hand-written digit classification by CNN and SVM  
  
stock market prediction: using LSTM-model in Pytorch
  
## CNN based hand written classification  
[train.py](./train.py) and [test.ipynb](./test.ipynb) is for CNN-based model.  
  
details in relevant report [report for CNN model](./1752919_祁好雨_CNN神经网络.pdf).
  
## SVM based hand written classification
[SVM.ipynb](./SVM.ipynb) and [SVM.html](./SVM.html) is for SVM-based model.  
  
details in relevant report [report for SVM model](./1752919_祁好雨_SVM手写数字识别实验报告.pdf).  
  
## LSTM based stock market prediction  
[benchmark.ipynb](./code/benchmark.ipynb) is the benchmark for stock market prediction and hyperparameters can be changed in class Args.  
  
[train.ipynb](./code/train.ipynb) is the lstm model prediction with feature engineering and data preprocessing, whose hyperparameters can be changed in class Args.
